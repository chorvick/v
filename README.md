## Description
    Our Vinyl Addict application is meant for each and every music lover.  This app allows our music fanbase, whether you are a "newer" music fan or a hardcore music lover, to share their collection of vinyl LPs with the rest of the community.  Not only can you share what albums you have, but you can also boast about that new found vinyl you came across at a local swap meet or garage sale.  Along with that, you can also comment on other community members posts.

## Installation
    First, you want to clone the repository from any one of our Github pages.  Once that is complete, you can open up the CLI of your choice and run the npm install command.  The package.json file will install every package needed to run our application.  When the install is successful, you have to open up MySQL Benchmark and create the database found in the DB folder we provided for you.  When that is completed, go back to your CLI and run npm start.  This allows your database to connect and then you can go to your localhost port and start using the application in your own way.  The possibilities will have you hooked on the community base and the variety of music everyone listens to.  Who knows, you may even find a genre of music you never knew existed!
